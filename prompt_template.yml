commit_format: "<type>(<scope>): <description>"
commit_type: |
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - style: Code style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
  - refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - test: Adding or updating tests
  - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

  Be concise, use imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "refactor"), and do not include file names unless absolutely necessary.
  If the scope is unclear, omit it (e.g., `feat: add user login`).
